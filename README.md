### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Adrian, a hobbyist Web Dev, primarily using TypeScript and playing with React. I'm also highly active on Discord and maintain multiple Discord Bots such as [Beemo](https://beemo.gg/) using Kotlin and Typescript.

You can find many of my current projects on [my University's GitLab](https://gitlab.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/__), where I code a lot of stuff for fellow students of the Applied Computer Science major. My tasks of being part of the student council include managing the server we use to run all of the services we provide for our students, such as our [blog](https://blog.ai-rub.de/) (in German), as well as developing custom tools useful to us and other students.

Formerly, I have been active in the Android modding scene, creating so-called Xposed Modules which hook into the system to customize its look and behavior; one of those (Android N-ify) had reached a substantial amount of popularity in the Android modding scene and even some media coverage.

Some of my open-source projects include:

- âœ¨ [FSI Self-Service](https://gitlab.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/fsi/idm/self-service-frontend), a custom, React-based single-page application for students of the faculty of computer science at Ruhr-University Bochum to manage their faculty accounts.
- The Multi-page application [self-service](https://gitlab.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/fs-ai/fsr/src/user-self-service) developed for the former (now deprecated/replaced) student authentication infrastructure.
- The frontend of [LISSY](https://gitlab.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/fs-ai/fsr/src/lissy/frontend), a web-based mobile application used by freshmen to play LIfe-Sized Scotland Yard to get to know the university campus.
- [Administr\[AI\]tor](https://gitlab.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/fs-ai/fsr/src/administraitor), a little TypeScript Discord bot for the Discord server run by and for students of the faculty.
- The frontend of [PollTool](https://gitlab.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/fs-ai/fsr/src/polltool/polltool-v2), a simple polling site where users can dynamically add items to vote on (Warning: My first ever React project, expect very bad code).
- Outside of all the aforementioned student council projects we have:
  - [cafe](https://github.com/beemobot/cafe), the open-source part of Beemo, an antiabuse bot for [Discord](https://discord.com/).
  - I am really proud of my contributions to the core parts of Beemo (written in Kotlin), but unfortunately, they are closed-source due to the sensitive nature of antiabuse handling. So far, I have contributed more than `50,000` changes in over `179` pull requests!
