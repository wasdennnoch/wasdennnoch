### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Adrian, a hobbyist Web Dev, primarily using TypeScript, and playing with React. I'm also highly active on Discord and maintain a Discord Bot (also written in TypeScript) for a verified Discord server.

You can find many of my current projects on [my University's GitLab](https://git.noc.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/paschaxj), where I code a lot of stuff for fellow students of the Applied Computer Science major. My tasks of being a student representative include managing the server we use to run all of the services we provide for our students, such as our [blog](https://blog.ai-rub.de/) (in German).

Formerly, I have been active in the Android modding scene, creating so-called Xposed Modules which hook into the system to customize its look and behavior; one of those (Android N-ify) had reached a substantial amount of popularity in the Android modding scene and even some media coverage.
