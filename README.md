### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm some random guy on the internet who codes stuff (duh, otherwise I wouldn't be on Github). Maybe you can find me on other sites with a similar username. Maybe not.

Nowadays I'm doing lots of stuff in the Web Dev area, mainly using Typescript. I'm also highly active on Discord and maintain a Discord Bot (written in Typescript) for a verified server.  
Many of my projects aren't on Github for various reasons sadly, so the stats you see here aren't representative of current-me anymore. Instead you can find old stuff from when I was active in the Android community. Oh well.

Have some random stats about me with this fancy widget everyone seems to be using now:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img align="center" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=wasdennnoch&count_private=true&include_all_commits=true&show_icons=true&hide_border=true&hide_title=true&theme=dracula" alt="Broken stats?">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

> Stats gathered by [`GitHub Readme Stats`](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)
